# Prints Hello "name"
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

# Modified 09/02/2025 @ 17:27 - added greeting line "nice to meet you" using \nNice to meet you to put it on a new name following input.

name = input("Enter your name:")
print('Hello ' + name + '\nNice to meet you')

# Alternative method of input - print(f'Hello {name}\nNice to meet you')

# END
