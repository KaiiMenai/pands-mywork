# multiply.py
# Prints output of 111*555
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

# Initially worksheet says to do "answer = 111 * 555"
# This did not yield answer - missing key term "print".

answer = 111 *555
print(answer)

#Following logic of hello.py using print would output correct answer

# print (111*555) - shorter version that could be used and still gets correct answer.
