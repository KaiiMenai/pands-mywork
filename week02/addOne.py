# addOne.py
# This program reads a number that is inputted and prints the input +1
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

number = int(input('please enter a number:'))
newNumber = number + 1
print (f'{number} plus one is {newNumber}')

# int (function) converts number input into an integer so that python sees it as a number not just as text input.
