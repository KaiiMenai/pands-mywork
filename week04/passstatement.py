# passstatement.py
# This program demonstrates the use of the "pass" statement in Python.
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

# The "pass" statement is used as a placeholder for future code.
# The "pass" statement is a null operation that does nothing.
# The "pass" statement is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.
# The "pass" statement is used to prevent an error when no action is required.
# The "pass" statement is used to create empty code blocks.
# The "pass" statement is used to create empty functions or classes.
# The "pass" statement is used to create empty loops.
# The "pass" statement is used to create empty if statements.
# The "pass" statement is used to create empty elif statements.
# The "pass" statement is used to create empty else statements.

# In this example, we will use the "pass" statement to create an empty code block.
# We will create an empty function called myfunction.
# We will use the "pass" statement to create an empty code block inside the function.

def myfunction():
    pass

# Output:
    # No output will be displayed as the function is empty.

# Even if there is an input, the function will not return anything as it is empty.

a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass

# Output:
    # No output will be displayed as the code block is empty.
