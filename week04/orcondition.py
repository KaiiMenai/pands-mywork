# orcondition.py
# This program demonstrates the use of the "or" condition in Python.
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

# The "or" condition is used to combine two conditional statements. 
# The "or" condition is true if one of the conditions is true.
# The "or" condition is an example of a logical operator.
# The "or" condition is used to check if at least one condition is true.
# If one of the conditions is true, the "or" condition will return true.

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")

# Output:
    # At least one of the conditions is True
    # This will print "At least one of the conditions is True" as one of the conditions is true.

# END
