# evens.py
# This program will use a while loop to print all the even numbers from 2 to 100.
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

numberto = 100
evennum = 2

# The pattern remains the same:
    # Initialise
    # Check
    # Change

while evennum <= numberto:  # While the even number is less than or equal to 100
    print (evennum)         # Print out the even number
    evennum += 2            # The previous even number + 2.

# Output:
    # 2
    # 4
    # 6
    # ...
    # 96
    # 98
    # 100
# This program has printed out every number between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
