# andcondition.py
# This program demonstrates the use of the "and" condition in Python.
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

# The "and" condition is used to combine two conditional statements.
# The "and" condition is only true if both the conditions are true.
# The "and" condition is an example of a logical operator.
# The "and" condition is used to check if both conditions are true.
# If both conditions are true, the "and" condition will return true.

# In this example, we will use the "and" condition to check if both conditions are true.
# We will check if a is greater than b and if c is greater than a.
# If both conditions are true, the "and" condition will return true.

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")

# Output:
    # Both conditions are True
    # This will print "Both conditions are True" as both conditions are true.
