# burritos.py
# This program will print the number of burritos a person has eaten. The person here is "I".
# author: Kyra Menai Hamilton

# The initial input provided doesn't work.

# message = 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
# print (message)

# This is due to the initial statement - 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
# To modify this so that it works.

number = int(99)
print("I have eaten {} burritos.".format(number))

# Modified: 11/-2/2025 @ 21:38 - Make it so that someone can input their own value/number of burritos.

# To be fancy about it and get someone to input their own value

# print("How many burritos have you eaten?")
# number = int(input("Enter number: "))
# print("You ate {} burritos.".format(number))
