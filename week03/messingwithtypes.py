# Messing with different types of variables and the functions that can be used with them.#

# Saying answer = 12 isn't enough, this is just a variable with a value, it hasn't been told to do anything. 
# So it won't show anything when run. Need to tell it to do something i.e. print(X).

answer = 12
print (f"The answer is {answer}.")
print(f"Type of answer is {type(answer)}")

# NOTES
# Variable names are case sensitive. If 'Answer' is typed instead of 'answer', it will give an error and say something like "answer is not defined".
# DO NOT add different variables that only differ by the capitalisation of a letter (in large datasets it'll be a nightmare).
# Make the code easy to read. Include explanations.

# Recommended that all variables start with a small letter.
# Python naming convention for particularly long variable names will include _ between words. In different programming languages this will be different. 
# Make sure that all variables have proper names, it will make it easier to read the code and understand what it does.
# MUST start variable names with a letter, NOT a number. Numbers can be in the middle of a variable name just not at the beginning.
# print(type(X)) will yield the type of variable that X is. Whether that is variable (e.g. answer as integer) as above.
