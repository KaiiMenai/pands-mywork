# The question here is how to get person 1 "Sam" to say "hi", and person 2 "me/I" to say "bye".
# This will include a tab input to seperate the description of the speaker and the speech. 
# The speech of both speakers needs to be in quotes and lign up (requiring 2 tabs for the respondent).

message = 'Sam said\t"Hi"\nI said\t\t"Bye"'
print(message)

# The output is:
    # Sam said        "Hi"
    # I said          "Bye"

# END
